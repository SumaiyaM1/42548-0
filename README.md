For this assignment, I decided to create an SOS game where two players can compete: 
a computer and a human user. The game is designed such that the first player to 
form an "SOS" sequence wins. I accomplished this by developing four classes: 
`Player`, `HumanPlayer`, `ComputerPlayer`, and `SOSGame`. The `Player` class serves 
as a base class containing shared player functionality, while the `HumanPlayer` class 
enables a human user to participate in the game. The `ComputerPlayer` class is 
responsible for the computer opponent's moves, and the `SOSGame` class oversees the 
game logic and board management. In this setup, the computer player is represented by 
the color red, and the human player is represented by blue, allowing for a straightforward 
and engaging gameplay experience where the user competes against the computer.
