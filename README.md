For this assignment, I decided to create an SOS game where two players can compete: 
a computer and a human user. The game is designed such that the first player to 
form an 'SOS' sequence wins. I accomplished this by developing four classes: 
'Player', 'HumanPlayer', 'ComputerPlayer', and 'SOSGame'. The 'Player' class serves 
as a base class containing shared player functionality, while the `HumanPlayer` class 
enables a human user to participate in the game. The 'ComputerPlayer' class is 
responsible for the computer opponent's moves, and the 'SOSGame' class oversees the 
game logic and board management. In this setup, the computer player is represented by 
the color red, and the human player is represented by blue, allowing for a straightforward 
and engaging gameplay experience where the user competes against the computer.
